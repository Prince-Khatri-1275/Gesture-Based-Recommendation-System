# Gesture Based Recommendation System
<br>

## Reason to make
This project was created by me, Prince Khatri, for my final semester main project its name is Gesture Based Recommendation System.
<br>

## But What is this
This project is as its name suggests an recommendation system with gestures base and as the detection of gesture in here was more mathematical then model based i only implemented it in the genre based recommendations and not whole recommendations .
But other recommendations are based on popularity, content based collaborative and hybrid recommendations.
<br>

## Future Scope

I will be adding more functionality like controlling some features with pupil movements, will add emotion based recognition and more gestures availability even though in its current stage it is capable of working on different datasets i will make it more robust to be able to work on different datasets even if they don't have the required attributes which we need currently.
